# Filesystem Forklift

Filesystem Migration Tool
-------------------------
Filesystem Forklift is an open source tool for migrating NFS and CIFS shares.  The goal is to quickly move large shares over the network through multiple Virtual Machines to a destination Gluster quickly and with little error.  Large shares these days may be considered impossible to move due to fact that it may take months to move the share.  Filesystem Forklift is intended to radically decrease the time needed to move the share, so that even seemingly impossibly large shares can be migrated to new clusters.
